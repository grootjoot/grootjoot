## Overview

This project was to get me back into the habit of creating stylized web pages with CSS and HTML elements. I do not currently work in or with any frameworks as I am growing my understanding of the native languages utilized.

## My process

My process was essentially working backwards from the finished product to break each element up into elements that I could then style. I began with the divs that would make-up/become the main 'body' rectangle then added the other elements in relation to that main one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned

In completing this project I learned that there is no limit to the amount you can learn through documentation, even if you thought you already knew how to complete a step. One major example of this was when I was trying to vertically center the div that houses the QR code and paragraphs, I had such a hard time trying to get it exactly centered with margins and translations so I ended up looking up other ways to center divs and ended on a version that alters the padding of the element to center it.

```css
.body {
    margin: 0 auto;
    height: 500px;
    max-width: 50%;
    position: relative;
    padding: 6% 0;
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects I think I will continue focusing on getting specific elements to be transformed in the way I want them to. I am still rusty in my ability to translate certain objects without them losing their formatting. Another focus I will have when working on future projects will be to measure values like scale, font size and font weight because I feel that there were some differences between the values I came up with and the original ones.
